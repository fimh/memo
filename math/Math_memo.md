### Calcuclus

Concept

* Calculus, originally called ``infinitesimal calculus``
* is the mathematical study of `continuous change`, is the same way that
    * `geometry` is the study of `shape`
    * `algebra` is the study of `generalizations of arithmetic operations`
* has two major branches
    * [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus)
        * the study of the rates at which quantities change
    * [integral calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus)
        * the study of the area beneath a curve

#### Differential Calculus

Concept

* primary objects of study
    * derivative of a function
    * related notions such as the differential
    * their applications
* differentiation
    * the process of finding a derivative
* derivative - measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value)
    * in a function of several variables
        * partial derivative
            * is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant
        * total derivative
            * used if [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus) and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry)
            * all variables are allowed to vary

Derivative

Suppose we have a linear equation `y = mx + b`, in this "slope-intercept form"

* the term `m` is called the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope), and can be determined from the formula: ![slope](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/433137b00708049d18711c32ff08f010e171c385)

> symbo `Δ` (the upppercase form of the Greek letter delta) is an abbreviation for "change in". It follows that `Δy = m Δx`

### Discrete Mathematics

#### Concept

Binary relation (part of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory))
* in mathematics, a binary relation over two sets A and B is a set of ordered pairs (a, b) consisting of elements a of A and elements b of B.
* are also heavily used in computer science
* includes
    * total order
    * simple order
    * linear order
    * connex order
    * full order
    * ...

Order theory
* is a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations.
* provides a formal framework for describing statements such as "this is less than that" or "this precedes that"

Weak ordering
* is a mathematical formalization of the intuitive notion of a ranking of a set, some of whose members may be tied with each other
* weak orders are a generalization of totally orders sets (rankings without ties) and are in turn generalized by [partially ordered sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) and [preorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder)

Strict weak orderings
* partially ordered sets in which incomparability is a transitive relation
* a strict weak ordering is a binary relation < on a set S that is a [strict partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_partial_order) (a [transitive relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation) that is [irreflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation), or equivalently, that is [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation)) in which the relation `neither a < b nor b < a` is transitive. Therefore, a strict weak ordering has the following properties:
    * For all `x in S`, it is not the case that `x < x` (irreflexivity)
    * For all `x, y in S`, if `x < y` then it is not the case that `y < x` (asymmetry)
    * For all `x, y, z in S`, if `x < y` and `y < z` then `x < z` (transitivity)
    * For all `x, y, z in S`, if `x` is incomparable with `y` (neither `x < y` nor `y < x` hold), and `y` is incomparable with `z`, the `x` is incomparable with `z` (transitivity of incomparability)

Total order
* a binary relation `<=` is a total order on a set `X` if the following statements hold for all `a`, `b` and `c` in `X`:
    * Antisymmetry - If ![a<=b](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41558abc50886fdf38817495b243958d7b3dd39b) and ![b<=a](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d38bff9a811bdd9b92516d9c2694712555b99952) then ![a=b](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1956b03d1314c7071ac1f45ed7b1e29422dcfcc4)
    * Transitivity - If ![a<=b](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41558abc50886fdf38817495b243958d7b3dd39b) and ![b<=c](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04cbc237b132cef779abc512c9c8e288781a808e) then ![a<=c](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb1c962997d8a303e076777cd6d6bc732f360ac8)
    * Connexity - ![a<=b](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41558abc50886fdf38817495b243958d7b3dd39b) or ![b<=a](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d38bff9a811bdd9b92516d9c2694712555b99952)

### Misc

Notation

* `↔`, [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) (shortented iff)

Closure

* definition
	* `Closure` describes the case when the results of a mathematical operation are always defined.
* sample
	* addition has closure in ordinary arithmetic. whenever one adds two numbers, the answer is a number. the same is true of multiplication.
	* division `does not` have closure, because division by 0 is not defined.
	* in the [`natural numbers`](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers), subtraction does not have closure, but in the [`integers`](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers) subtraction does have closure. because subtraction of two numbers can produce a negative number, which is not a natural number, but it is an integer.
* types
	* finite closure - ordinary closure is called finite closure (i.e. the above samples)
	* infinite closure - the definition of a [`topological space`](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space) mentions infinite closure
		* open spaces have (finite) closure of [intersection](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection). open sets have infinite closure of [union](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory))
